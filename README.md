# EASIER PROJECT

The EASIER project is being developed by the Human Language and Accessibility Technologies (HULAT) research group (http://hulat.inf.uc3m.es/ )of the Computer Science department of the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M). 
The objective of the project is to develop technological solutions that improve accessibility in access to web content for people with intellectual disabilities, the elderly, and all people in general. It offers a web system with an accessible interface that provides systematic lexical simplification of Spanish texts. 

With this goal, a web system is offered (http://easier.hulat.uc3m.es/) that increases cognitive accessibility and provides various language tools. The web system is designed optimizing cognitive accessibility features following easy-to-read, plain language guidelines, as well as WCAG 2.1 (Level AA). This web system can be accessed from the desktop computer or from the mobile. In addition, a browser extension is offered (Chrome and Firefox).

The EASIER system, with its service-oriented architecture, provides a range of resources to improve cognitive accessibility. Complex words are identified within a Spanish text, and different services are offered, such as synonyms, definitions and pictograms, for each complex word. These language services are obtained using Natural Language Processing methods with automatic learning approaches providing a systematic process. 

Following a user-centred approach, the project proposal is designed and evaluated considering the collaboration of organizations and associations of people with intellectual disabilities such as Plena Inclusión Madrid and Grupo AMÁS.

This work was supported by the Accessible Technologies award - INDRA Technologies and the Fundación Universia (www.tecnologiasaccesibles.com  ), and the Research Program of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness - Government of Spain, (DeepEMR project TIN2017-87548-C2-1-R).
